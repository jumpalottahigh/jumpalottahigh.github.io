---------
	-Changed the bloodsplatter to use a quick&dirty sprite
	-Made the character jump to a maze level from the house
	-Added enemies to the maze
	-Camera "safety distance" is now higher because of the maze level, which means that the camera is near the player. You can fix this by moving the camera min&max gameobjects

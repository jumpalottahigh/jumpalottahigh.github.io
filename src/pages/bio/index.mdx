## Short bio

Iâ€™m Georgi, 33 year old, european citizen, born in Bulgaria.

So far in my live I have lived in Bulgaria, Cyprus, the USA and for the past 6 years in Finland.

I have a Finnish Swedish spouse that I met in Cyprus 6 years ago and she is the reason I came here.

We have a 3 year old son together.

I love programming, web development, and performant web pages.

One of my biggest passions is buiding high quality web experiences, that load fast, work seamlessly, are interactive quick and work even on older devices.

I like my job, because I have been able to make an impact not only by contributing but also by coming up with and implementing ideas of my own.

I love JavaScript and React!

## Feedback

&bdquo;Technically very competent fellow who can adapt any technology or framework very fast&ldquo;

&bdquo;Supporting other fellows and has done so in many occations during the AEM project&ldquo;

&bdquo;Excellent in written communication using tools like Jira, Teams, Slack and Trello&ldquo;

&bdquo;Very good in sharing ideas and resources among team members&ldquo;

&bdquo;Always challenging the status quo&ldquo;

&bdquo;Of all the developers here, Georgi is most up to the date on latest best practices in web development as far as I see. That is pushing us to be better every day. I would assume that this is due to his genuine interest in the subject. That is the only thing that will keep one up to date in a fast moving industry such as web development.&ldquo;

&bdquo;Deep knowledge and always up-to-date with the latest technology&ldquo;

## Before web dev

I was born and raised in Bulgaria, where I finished high school with extensive education in Information Technology and English language in the class of 2004.

I applied to study International Economics Relations and got accepted in second place after passing the exams with high scores. This gave me the opportunity to go to the USA in 2005 and 2006.

While in the states I worked as a bus person (helper in a restaurant), housekeeping, maintenance and other positions not very related to my major, I learned a lot. It was a great chance for me to practice speaking English with native speakers.

I traveled alone and had to deal with numerous challenging situation on my own and that was a great learning opportunity.

-

After 2 years working on my degree, I decided to ditch it for a number of reasons, many of which have to do with the way Bulgarian education is structured. While it's generally fairly good education, it is tedious, corrupted, teaches sometimes outdated things and not at all practical.

It so happened that after my return from the states in 2006, I dropped out of University and started a new period in my life. I got my first full time, serious job in Bulgaria - working as a waiter in a 4-star hotel in Plovdiv.

After 6 months I was promoted to a shift manager and had to supervise events, such as weddings, banquets and more. This was a smooth and steady period in which I just relaxed and enjoyed a steady paycheck, no worries, playing games, going out with friends.

-

In 2010 I was done with that lifestyle as I could easily see how I could spend my life like this and not really do anything else. And I wanted to do other things. So, I went to Cyprus. It was hard, but eventually, I overcame the difficulties. The story is an interesting and long one.

The bottom line is that at the end of the day, Cyprus was a change, somewhat turmoiling time, but a change for the better as it leads me to meet my partner.

Eventually, we got together, we both sacrificed things for each other and moved places to be with each other. We live in Cyprus and Bulgaria and eventually Finland.

Here I worked as a person that picks up glasses and stocks the bar in a night club. I hated going there but it was a means to an end and eventually, after doing it for 2 years I could finally quit.

During those 2 years, I completed the better part of my degree and in the end graduated 1 year ahead of schedule, got my first web development job and got a son with my partner.

-

Which brings us to almost nowadays and the past 3-4 years, where I've been focusing on getting better at building things on the web. Both at work and in my free time. I'm still fairly excited and love building applications and solving real problems.

I picked up a few hobbies along the way. For instance, flying FPV drones, smart home automation. Both have a lot to do with embedded engineering and dealing with small sensors, boards, soldering, and configuration. Fun!

I also maintain a blog that is read by ~ 2000 people monthly and I love being able to share knowledge from experiences, which is what my articles do. This desire and skill manifests also in another way - I give workshops (Gatsby, React, ES6) at work and shorter educational session. On top of it all, I also stream live coding on Twitch and I upload educational videos on YouTube.

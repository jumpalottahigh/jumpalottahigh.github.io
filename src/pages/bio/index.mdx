## Short bio

Iâ€™m Georgi, 33 year old, european citizen, born in Bulgaria.

So far in my live I have lived in Bulgaria, Cyprus, the USA and for the past 6 years in Finland.

I have a Finnish Swedish spouse that I met in Cyprus 6 years ago and she is the reason I came here.

We have a 3 year old son together.

I love programming, web development, and performant web pages.

One of my biggest passions is buiding high quality web experiences, that load fast, work seamlessly, are interactive quick and work even on older devices.

I like my job, because I have been able to make an impact not only by contributing but also by coming up with and implementing ideas of my own.

I love JavaScript and React!

## Feedback

&bdquo;Technically very competent fellow who can adapt any technology or framework very fast&ldquo;

&bdquo;Supporting other fellows and has done so in many occations during the AEM project&ldquo;

&bdquo;Excellent in written communication using tools like Jira, Teams, Slack and Trello&ldquo;

&bdquo;Very good in sharing ideas and resources among team members&ldquo;

&bdquo;Always challenging the status quo&ldquo;

&bdquo;Of all the developers here, Georgi is most up to the date on latest best practices in web development as far as I see. That is pushing us to be better every day. I would assume that this is due to his genuine interest in the subject. That is the only thing that will keep one up to date in a fast moving industry such as web development.&ldquo;

&bdquo;Deep knowledge and always up-to-date with the latest technology&ldquo;

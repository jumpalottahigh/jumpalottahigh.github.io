## Short bio

Iâ€™m Georgi, 33 year old, european citizen, born in Bulgaria.

So far in my live I have lived in Bulgaria, Cyprus, the USA and for the past 6 years in Finland.

I have a Finnish Swedish spouse that I met in Cyprus 6 years ago and she is the reason I came here.

We have a 3 year old son together.

I love programming, web development, and performant web pages.

One of my biggest passions is working to improve page loading times, interactivity, user experience.

I have been able to make an impact not only by contributing but also by coming up with my own ideas and implementing them.

I strongly believe that React is an awesome library and I really love using it!
